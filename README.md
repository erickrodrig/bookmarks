# Template of my dev bookmarks

This is a simple template of how I organize my bookmarks and also some of the sites that I use. Change as you need.

## How to use

Simply download the bookmarks HTML file in the latest release or directly, then go to your browser settings and import the file to load the bookmarks.

## Important

Don't use a fork of this project to keep track of your bookmarks, or better saying, don't use GitHub to keep track of your bookmarks at all! If you're doing that in a **public** repository, when adding bookmarks that may include unique IDs, it will expose them to the internet, so, the best option is to use your browser's sync option with your cloud storage to back up your bookmarks!
